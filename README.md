# [Project 1 : Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/FeniRahmi/CC_segmentation)
* Created a model that estimate credit card customer segmentation to help the company to define marketing strategy.
* The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months.
* The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.
* Using K-Means algorithm with the K value determined by silhouette score.
* Using PCA for dimension reduction and better visualization.

# [Project 2 : Titanic Survival Passenger using Random Forest Algorithm](https://github.com/FeniRahmi/Titanic)
* For this example project I predicted the survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) from the Titanic passenger.
* Using Random Forest classifier.
* Creating new feature (feature engineering).
* The submission score in kaggle is 0.76, which not bad for the first attempt.

# [Project 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis : Nutrition Fact for McDonald's Menu](https://github.com/FeniRahmi/McDonald_EDA)
I have explored the McDonald's dataset to find the answers for the following questions:
* How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain?
* How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake?
* Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value?
* What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs?
